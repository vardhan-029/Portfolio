            <p><b>Bone Fracture Detection</b></p>
            
 <p>Bone fractures are the very common injuries which require immediate and correct
diagnosis to treat patients effectively. Conventionally, traditional radiographic
assessment is usually performed by radiologists, whose accuracy varies largely.
Treatment may be delayed for this reason alone. This work discusses the potential of
advanced deep learning model YOLOv8 for automated bone fracture detection from
medical images. We used a large dataset containing multiple varieties of radiographs
with labeled fractures and trained the YOLOv8 model to recognize and classify different
types of fractures. The results obtained from our experiments show that the YOLOv8
model is quite accurate, sensitive, and specific for fracture detections. Such results are
quite outstanding and comparable with conventional diagnosis techniques. The time
needed to make detection for fractures can be significantly reduced, but this will not
compromise on a high level of reliability.</p>
